# Personal-Finance-Tracker

The Personal Finance Management System aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform to manage their finances efficiently. The system allows users to register and log in, input their monthly salary, and track their investments such as stocks and provident funds (PF). One of the key features is the generation of a monthly expenses overview presented in a pie chart, illustrating the percentage distribution of the user's salary across various expense categories.
